Predicting Customer Interest in Enhanced Travel Insurance with COVID cover
A tour & travels company is offering travel insurance package to their customers. The new insurance 
package also includes covid cover. The company wants to know which customers would be interested to 
buy it based on their database history. The insurance was offered to some of the customers in 2019 and 
the given data has been extracted from the performance/sales of the package during that period. The data 
is provided for almost 2000 of its previous customers and the goal is to build a model that can predict if 
the customer will be interested to buy the travel insurance package. Iâ€™ve withheld 100 observations to see 
how your model performs. You will submit your final prediction on these 100 observations in the 
provided csv file (TravelInsuranceTest.csv) along with your project paper.
