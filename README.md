✔️ Customer Interest Prediction in Travel Insurance: Developed a predictive model using Gradient Boosting to identify potential buyers for a new travel insurance package, including COVID coverage. 🛫📊

Key Steps & Techniques:
✔️ Data Cleaning & Exploration: Addressed missing values, removed irrelevant features, and performed ANOVA tests to identify key predictors such as Age, Annual Income, Frequent Flyer status, and Travel History. 🛠️🔍

✔️ Class Imbalance Handling: Adjusted thresholding techniques to address dataset imbalance (63% opted out, 37% opted in), ensuring better model performance. ⚖️📉

✔️ Feature Selection: Identified "Age," "Annual Income," and "Ever Travelled Abroad" as the most significant features contributing to the model’s predictive power. 🎯📊

Model Training & Evaluation:
✔️ Model Comparison: Evaluated five machine learning models—Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and Linear Discriminant Analysis. 📊🔍

✔️ Best Model - Gradient Boosting: Achieved 83.1% accuracy, 16.9% test error rate, and 90.8% recall, outperforming other models. 🏆📈

✔️ Cross-Validation & Regularization: Tuned hyperparameters (shrinkage, interaction depth) to enhance performance. 🔄⚙️

✔️ Predictive Insights: The model was applied to 100 unseen data points, correctly identifying 81 as "No" and 19 as "Yes" for purchasing travel insurance. 🔮📊

Business Impact:
✔️ Actionable Insights: Helped optimize marketing strategies by identifying key factors influencing customer interest. 🎯📢

✔️ Deployment Considerations: Emphasized balancing false positives (unnecessary purchases) and false negatives (missed customers) before model deployment. ⚠️🔍

This project showcased the power of predictive modelling in driving business decisions, refining customer targeting, and enhancing travel insurance adoption strategies. 🚀📈
